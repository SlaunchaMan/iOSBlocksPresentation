This presentation covers iOS development using blocks, Apple’s new addition to the Objective-C language. Here’s a short description of the files included:

  * **block_typedefs.c**: This file shows how to use typedefs to make writing blocks cleaner and much more concise.
  * **blocks_capture_scope.c**: This file shwos how blocks capture values from their surrounding scope.
  * **blocks_dont_modify_scope.c**: This file shows how blocks modify the values they capture—or rather, how they don’t! Don’t expect this one to compile.
  * **blocks_retain_objects.m**: This file shows how blocks retain Objective-C objects in their surrounding scope. At first glance, this should fail with an `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` error, but it works!
  * **dispatch_example.c**: This shows a basic use of dispatch queues.
  * **helloblock.c**: This is the “Hello, world!” of writing blocks. Literally.
